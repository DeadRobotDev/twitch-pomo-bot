# twitch-pomo-bot
A Twitch chat bot for co-working streams that allows viewers to set their own task. The tasks are saved to a text file so they can be displayed in OBS.

## Installation
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DeadRobotDev/twitch-pomo-bot/releases).

**NOTE:** Microsoft Defender Antivirus may flag the executable. It is a false positive, but you can read and build the source code yourself if you're unsure.

- Run `twitch-pomo-bot.exe`.

**WARNING:** Do **NOT** stream this part, or the `config.json` file. It includes an OAuth token that allows user to post to any Twitch chat from your bot account without logining in.

It will take you through the initial set up process, and create a `config.json` file. You can edit this manually if you wish to change the command prefix (default: `!`), or the bot responses.

### Display in OBS
- Add a `Text` source.
- Select `Read from File`.
- Select `Browse`.
- Select the `viewer_tasks.txt` file.

## Commands
- `!task` - Replies with the help message.
- `!task add <task name>`
- `!task edit <new task name>`
- `!task done` OR `!task complete`
- `!task cancel` OR `!task delete`

## Planned Features
- Mod commands.
- Timed tasks (aka pomodoros).
- Disable individual bot responses.
